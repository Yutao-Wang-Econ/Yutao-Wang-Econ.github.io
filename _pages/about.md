**Welcome to my site!** 

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [School of Economics at Singapore Management University (SMU)](https://economics.smu.edu.sg/). My research interests lie in the economics of the family and labor economics. My work involves reduced-form and structural modelling approaches. Recent projects aim to explore the implications of parental investments in children, fertility behaviors, and female labor supply.
