### Bio
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [School of Economics](https://economics.smu.edu.sg/), [Singapore Management University (SMU)](https://www.smu.edu.sg/). My research interests lie in labor and development economics with four core areas: intra-household
allocation, investment in children, migration, and gender. I leverage both structural estimation methods and reduced-form techniques to explore the mechanisms underlying trade-offs between the quantity and quality of children, as well as trade-offs between female labor supply and family formation. 

**<span style="color: #006692;">I will be on the 2024-2025 Economics Job Market and will be available for interviews.**

Here is my [CV](../files/CV_Yutao_Wang.pdf).<br /> 
Here is my [Job Market Paper](../files/JMP_YutaoWANG.pdf).<br />
